# IoP Profile Server

The Profile Server is a core component of [Internet of People architecture](https://hackernoon.com/fermat-the-internet-of-people-and-the-person-to-person-economy-ce933865a0b0). 
If you are not familiar with IoP, the Profile Server itself will probably make not much sense to you. If that is the case, it is highly recommended to explore IoP first before you 
start with the Profile Server. See the IoP architecture post linked above and then possibly continue with [more articles about IoP](https://medium.com/@luisfernandomolina).


## Installation

Are you interested to run the Profile Server software on your machine? See [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) file on how to proceed.
