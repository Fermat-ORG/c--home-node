# Profile Server Network Layer

This gives us a chance to divide this layer to three groups of components and modules by the protocol they are mostly connected to.


## Profile Server Protocol

### Network Server Component

### TCP Role Server

### Message Processor

### Incoming Client

### Relay Connection

### Application Services



## Location Based Network Protocol

### Location Based Network Component

### Neighborhood Action Processor

### Outgoing Client
